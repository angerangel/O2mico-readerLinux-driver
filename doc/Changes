--------
Version:        2.0.3	2005/10/13
Author:         Jeffrey Dai
Changes:
Changed the configure-debug/configure-release file to check kernel version and see 
if it's older then 2.6.13.  This is because PCMCIA module structure is changed in
this version. Now there two src directories named ozscrlx-2.6 and ozscrlx-2.6.13.

--------
Version:	2.0.2
Author:		Jeffrey Dai
Changes:

call and cs_error prototype.
